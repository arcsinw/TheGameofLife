## Conway's Game of Life

> The Game of Life is not your typical computer game. It is a 'cellular automaton', and was invented by Cambridge mathematician John Conway.
>
> This game became widely known when it was mentioned in an article published by Scientific American in 1970. It consists of a collection of cells which, based on a few mathematical rules, can live, die or multiply. Depending on the initial conditions, the cells form various patterns throughout the course of the game.

### Rule

For a space that is 'populated':

- Each cell with one or no neighbors dies, as if by solitude.

- Each cell with four or more neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.

- Each cell with two or three neighbors survives.

For a space that is 'empty' or 'unpopulated'

- Each cell with three neighbors becomes populated.
